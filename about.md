# About Me

I'm Abhilash Rejanair, a Staff Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience building and scaling cloud-native systems across fintech and e-commerce domains. I specialize in architecting scalable microservices, leading zero-downtime migrations, and optimizing high-performance systems that handle millions of transactions. I'm passionate about cloud architecture, system design, and mentoring engineering teams to build robust, maintainable solutions using technologies like C#, Go, TypeScript, Java, and AWS.

### What I Build

I write code that scales. My day-to-day involves architecting distributed systems, debugging performance bottlenecks, and shipping features that handle millions of requests. I've personally migrated legacy monoliths to microservices, rewritten APIs to cut latency, and built CI/CD pipelines that deploy code safely at scale.

When I'm not writing code, I'm reviewing it, optimizing database queries, or diving deep into system metrics to understand how things actually perform in production. I believe the best architecture comes from understanding the code at every level.

### Tech Stack

**Languages**: Go, TypeScript, Java, C#, Ruby - I pick the right tool for the job

**Cloud**: AWS (EC2, Lambda, RDS, SQS), Azure, Kubernetes for orchestration

**Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis - from schema design to query optimization

**Infrastructure**: Docker containers, Infrastructure as Code, monitoring and observability

### Engineering Philosophy

I build things that work reliably at scale. This means writing tests, setting up proper monitoring, handling edge cases, and thinking about what happens when things go wrong. I've debugged production issues at 3am and learned that good engineering prevents most of those calls.
